My final project for Wesleyan University Music 220 (Experimental Music Composition). Generates songs using two instruments based on a single line input. Still quite rough. Written in [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/). To install, place in your SuperCollider class directory.

Sample recordings will be available shortly.
